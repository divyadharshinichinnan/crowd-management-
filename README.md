# Crowd-management-and-stampede-response
This project allows us to find the density of people using the threshold frame and can detect the number of people in the crowd which is present in the uploaded image using haar cascade classifier algorithm. The uploaded images are the snaphots of the live video and the threshold frame is used for accurately unearthing the objects .The motion of crowd is detected from the source of live video coverage.

//Haar cascade classifier

A Haar Cascade is basically a classifier which is used to detect particular objects from the source. The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is a haar cascade designed by OpenCV to detect the frontal face.  
A Haar Cascade works by training the cascade on thousands of negative images with the positive image superimposed on it. The haar cascade is capable of detecting features from the source.
